		<h1>About Me</h1><br><hr id="hr2"><br>

		<img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="profilepic" alt="Image of Shannon">

		<p>I am a graphic designer and professional photographer based in Sacramento, California. My life long passion for art has lead me to explore the medium in all it’s forms. A photographer from age 18, my interest in art has grown and expanded with me through the years.

		When I was getting started I obsessed about photography. Framing, composition, color theory, zone systems, gear, lighting and posing became my life. I read every book and listened to so many valuable mentors share their knowledge. I shot, and shot, and shot creating a catalog of hundreds of thousands of stock images, corporate hero shots, food photography, weddings and births. So many personal creations. After many years of happy study and 15 years owning a successful photography business that world because routine. Work, rather than pulsing drive. I knew I needed a new ambition. Stat.</p><br>

		<p>My years in photography had made me an expert in Photoshop and retouching — an art all by itself. I decided to expand this digital art knowledge with a degree in Graphic Design from Sacramento State. A notoriously difficult design program honed my skills and delivered me into a new and exciting world — design. The pulsing drive returned.</p><br>

		<p>Here I discovered logo creation, layout and branding. Grid systems made me giddy, special printing process thrilled me to no end. I explored every facet of the medium: print work, web design, animation. Every skill building on the next. I currently utilize all of these skills at Page Design Group, a creative firm specializing in publication and web design. I love what I do. I love how many tools I have in my tool belt. I can take a project from beginning to end without outsourcing any of the creative which allows me to fully realize every concept exactly how I see it. </p><br>

		<p>Well, every piece of the creative except one. Enter web programming. This feels like the last unexplored frontier in my quest for complete activation in all things creative. My love of art, love of learning and love of challenge has landed me here. I can’t wait to explore this new world and dive deep into its possibilities. </p><br>

		<p>Let’s DO this thang!<p>
